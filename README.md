# Rock Ppaer Scissors Game
This project is a Python-based implementation of the popular game "Rock, Paper, Scissors". It provides the opportunity to play the game against a computer, which makes its moves based on random choice. The project is a meaningful exercise for students who already grasp the Python basics and want to dive into something more challenging and hands-on.
